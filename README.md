# The Village
>_It takes a village to raise a child._

You're likely familiar with this old proverb. And while many members of our modern society may have children, there are very, very few among us who have a village at our disposal. This is where _The Village_ app seeks to assist users.

## Description

Using _The Village_ app, users can create a private "village" or join a pre-existing village in their location by using their zip code. Users are granted "crayons" (the app's local form of currency) when they create a profile. These crayons can be used to trade for favors related to childcare with fellow villagers. 

For a detailed explanation of how to use the app, see the Usage section below.
